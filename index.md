title: Quark-Gluon Tomography collaboration
---

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">
This collaborative effort supported by US Department of Energy (DOE) aims to delve into the intricate realm of "3D quark-gluon structure of hadrons: mass, spin, and tomography." The collaboration is built upon three foundational pillars: theory, lattice QCD, and phenomenology. The interplay among these pillars will foster a robust synergy, ultimately yielding fresh perspectives and profound insights into the overarching questions in the field.
