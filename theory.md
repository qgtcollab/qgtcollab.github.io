The theory advances will focus on the foundation of applying QCD factorization theorems, including higher-order perturbative corrections and all-order resummations, to DVCS and other relevant hard exclusive processes with the goal of extracting GPDs. The theory pillar will also provide the necessary ingredients to extract the GPDs from a global analysis. In addition, we will explore non-perturbative methods to provide important insight to describe the GPDs, which can lead to a physics motivated parameterization for the global analysis.

In particular, our research will focus on the following subjects: 

(1) Theory Advances in Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering

(2) Gluon Tomography with Exclusive Heavy Quarkonium Production

(3) New Processes and Observables for Probing GPDs

(4) Non-perturbative Methods for GPDs and Hadron Tomography

(5) Beyond GPDs: Wigner Distributions

The milestones from the theory working group are in three main categories: 1) application of perturbative QCD to hard exclusive processes; 2) non-perturbative methods, including and the Covariant Parton Model; and 3) processes at small-x. 

Year 1: Analyze factorization for exclusive quarkonia production at leading power for all regions using SCET and NRQCD, including the large and small $Q^2$ regions and quarkonia production at threshold

Apply the light-front Hamiltonian method to compute the GPDs, explore the nucleon spin/mass sum rule, and help to unveil the parton correlation due to strong interaction non-perturbative physics

Year 2: Make quantitative connection of the GPD factorization formalism to the CGC/color-dipole formalism for various exclusive processes

Apply the Covariant Parton Model to the GPDs of quark and gluons, eventually the parton Wigner distributions


Year 3: Use SCET to investigate factorization at subleading power in DVCS, including hadron mass corrections and the factorization and resummation of potential endpoint singularities

Year 4: Perform large-$N_c$ analysis of hard exclusive pion production with $N \rightarrow \Delta$ transitions and a combined chiral $\times 1/N_c$ analysis of nucleon energy-momentum tensor form factors

Quantitative study of hard diffractive dijet and di-hadron production at future EIC  and explore novel processes to probe the quark/gluon Wigner distribution in the valence and moderate $x$ region

Year 5: Study relativistic corrections and other subleading effects in heavy quarkonia production for cases where such corrections are likely to be important
