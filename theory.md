The theory advances will focus on the foundation of applying QCD factorization theorems, including higher-order perturbative corrections and all-order resummations, to DVCS and other relevant hard exclusive processes with the goal of extracting GPDs. The theory pillar will also provide the necessary ingredients to extract the GPDs from a global analysis. In addition, we will explore non-perturbative methods to provide important insight to describe the GPDs, which can lead to a physics motivated parameterization for the global analysis.

Our research will focus on the following important questions: 

Theory Advances in Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering

Gluon Tomography with Exclusive Heavy Quarkonium Production

New Processes and Observables for Probing GPDs

Non-perturbative Methods for GPDs and Hadron Tomography

Beyond GPDs: Wigner Distributions
